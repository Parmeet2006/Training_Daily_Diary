## 🎯 Overview & Objectives

Session 8 focused on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python[cite: 9]. We explored how to transition from procedural programming to domain-driven structural modeling by identifying entities, mapping 1-to-1 and 1-to-many relationships, inspecting heap/stack memory references, and writing constructor routines using the `__init__` dunder method[cite: 9, 10, 11, 12].

## 🧠 Key Concepts & Learning Summary

### 1. Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming
* **Three Principles of OOP:**
  1. Identify and visualize real-world entities (Attributes & Relationships)[cite: 9].
  2. Create a textual representation / blueprint by defining a `class`[cite: 9].
  3. Instantiate real objects in memory via Object Construction Statements[cite: 9].
* **Real-World vs. Computer Science Definitions:**
  * **Class:** Blueprint / structural representation of an object[cite: 9].
  * **Object:** A heterogeneous/homogeneous storage container initialized in heap memory[cite: 9, 11].

### 2. Relationship Mapping in Domain Design
* **1-to-1 Mapping:** A `Restaurant` object holds a single `Menu` instance attribute[cite: 9, 10].
* **1-to-Many Mapping:** A `Menu` object holds a list of multiple `Dish` instances[cite: 9, 10].
* **Dynamic Property Binding:** Python allows dynamic attribute assignment, updating (`obj.attr = val`), deletion (`del obj.attr`), and inspection (`vars(obj)`) at runtime[cite: 10, 12].

### 3. Constructor Mechanics (`__init__`) & Memory Management
* **`self` Pointer:** A reference variable inside instance methods that holds the memory address (`id()`) of the current object residing on the heap[cite: 11, 12].
* **Stack vs. Heap Memory:** The reference variable (LHS) resides in the call stack, pointing to the constructed container (RHS) allocated on the heap[cite: 11].
* **No Constructor Overloading:** Defining a second `__init__` method overwrites the previous definition in memory[cite: 12].
